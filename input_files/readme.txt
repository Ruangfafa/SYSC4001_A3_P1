Scenario 1 — Mixed-heavy baseline
Scenario 2 — High CPU load + asynchronous IO
Scenario 3 — IO-heavy stress test
Scenario 4 — CPU-heavy dominance test
Scenario 5 — Mixed with close arrival times
Scenario 6 — Many small IO bursts
Scenario 7 — Long IO duration dominance
Scenario 8 — Low CPU, frequent IO
Scenario 9 — Wide arrival spread + CPU-heavy
Scenario 10 — Short arrival, mixed processing
Scenario 11 — Early I/O–Bound vs Late CPU–Bound Processes
Scenario 12 — Many Short Tasks with One Extremely Long CPU Task
Scenario 13 — Long Multi-I/O Tasks Mixed with Zero-I/O Short Tasks
Scenario 14 — Early-Trigger vs Late-Trigger I/O Frequency Comparison
Scenario 15 — Wide Arrival Time Distribution with Mixed Workloads
Scenario 16 — High-Frequency Short I/O — Context Switch Stress Test
Scenario 17 — Very Long I/O Tasks Mixed with Medium CPU Tasks
Scenario 18 — Dense Early Arrivals with a Late Heavy CPU Task
Scenario 19 — Similar I/O Frequencies but Divergent CPU Bursts
Scenario 20 — Mid-to-Long Tasks with Widely Different I/O Stages
